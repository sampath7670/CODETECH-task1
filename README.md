## PROGRAM FOR: SIMPLE CALCULATOR ##

# Objective #

Create a Python program that acts as a basic calculator. It should prompt the user to enter two numbers and choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Then, it should perform the selected operation and display the result to the user.

# KEY ACTIVITIES #

-Input Collection:
The program prompts the user to enter two numbers (num1 and num2) as input.
It also asks the user to select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
-Operations:
The program defines four functions for different mathematical operations:
add(x, y): Adds two numbers.
subtract(x, y): Subtracts the second number from the first.
multiply(x, y): Multiplies the two numbers.
divide(x, y): Divides the first number by the second (handles division by zero).
-User Choice:
Based on the user’s input (choice), the program performs the selected operation.
-Output Display:
The program displays the result of the chosen operation.
